a) Implement the endpoints below for:
GET: /box POST: /box DELETE: /box

b) Implement an endpoint to sort the boxes by street name, date and weight (length of items). So our delivery guys can plan delivery routes easier ;)
GET: /find

* Optional c)
Import the example_data.csv as a file system to make the data available for the 4 endpoints already created.
