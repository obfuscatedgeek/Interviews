# Interview assignment with Mesosphere
    Problem set and the AngularJS based solution as submitted by me. Unfortunately did not get selected :-(
    
    I actually liked their assignment & as I am trying to learn ReactJS I tried to implement the same solution in ReactJS
    with Flux based architecture using Fluxxor.
